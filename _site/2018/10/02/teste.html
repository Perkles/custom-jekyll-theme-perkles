<hr />

<p>Two years and five months ago I’ve received the notice that I would be a father. I had 23. This notice who bring joy and happiness, for me, despite all that, also brought preoccupation. I begin to question a lot of things like my career, social status, and my capability to handle responsibilities.</p>

<p>In that period I had quit biology college and begin to work in a supermarket with my family to handle money.
A big question began to take form inside my head. I want to raise my son with my supermarket’s salary or run for something more rewarding in order to provide a more solid and concise source of money?</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, a ‘ bag boy’ is a fair job, but I’m an unsettled guy I’ve always running to find something who challenge me and make me come up with something new.
I’ve begun to work during the day in the supermarket and taking a course in technology at a university at night. Right in the first period of college, I’ve realized that I’ve been there with a different goal, I need to highlight myself from my colleagues to get a job faster.</p>

<p>Isn’t just the responsibility of being a father that push me further in that goal, my passion for programming also help me take a straight line in my studies.
I noticed a huge difference in my mindset compared with the period that I’ve spend taking biology classes i don’t know if being a father has influence in that or it is just the fact that I like programming more than biology, maybe a combination of both.</p>

<p>I just want to keep it recorded in this post and say that I’m a young father and I’m proud of it.</p>
